# Welcome to my Portfolio!

## About this project

My portfolio is to showcase what I have learned up to this point during the Front-End Track of the UCF Split Stack Sofware Development Program. This project showcases technologies such as:

- Javascript
- CSS
- React

## Things I learned during this project

During this project, I feel I was able to better understand how to properly use the router and props. Considering this project has many moving parts, it took me a little bit to fully understand the structure in which I was working with.

One thing I had difficulty with was getting the projects.js data to show on the webpage. I then realized I wasn't passing any parameters for my ProjectCard function. So it ended up being a pretty easy fix. This project has allowed me to work on my attention to detail such as making sure I had the correct syntax or capitalizations where needed.

## Things I want to improve on this project

### Possible additional implementations:

- PDF viewer for my resume with possibly a download option for potential employers
- Making the contact form a working form that sends the information to myself to actually recieve submissions
